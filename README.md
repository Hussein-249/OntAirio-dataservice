> A Spring Boot microservice to query for flights offered by a fictional airline

# Purpose

<i>This microservice is part of a larger personal project, Project OntAirio.</i>

Flight searching and booking requires significant backend calculations and communications with the backend database. As such a dedicated service to handle queries adds a layer of abstraction and modularity between requests from both mobile applications and desktop clients.

To further the modularity of an airline's backend and web services, this microservice only serves business-related queries. User authentication and management is handled by a separate microservice.

# Installation & Environment

## Packages

This microservice is built with Spring Boot. Dependencies are as follows:

- ```JUnit``` and ```Mockito``` (see [Tests](#tests))

## Runtime Environment

This app is developed with JDK 17.

# Tests

<div id="tests">
Coming soon.
</div>

## Implemented Features
None (still in progress)
## Developing Features
Coming soon.
# Documentation

This microservice will be fairly straightforward as the data model is fairly simple, with only a few entities (tables).

Documentation will be completed when this microservice has reached MVP stage.
